Dataset by: Asaniczka

This dataset is a continuation of @baynebrannen's 2020 Video Game Sales dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/baynebrannen/video-game-sales-2020) and @ashaheedq's 2019 Video Games Sales dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashaheedq/video-games-sales-2019).

Creation of this dataset was inspired by @VinceTheCat02.

Data was collected by running the spider written by @baynebrannen to create his version of the dataset.

* I haven't made any major modification to the collection methodology or the dataset structure.
* I have removed a few unhelpful columns such as 'vg_score', 'user_score', and 'total_shipped' as these columns mostly contained null values.
* All the other columns remain the same.
